= How to contribute

You don't need to be an experienced CK2 modder, just the will to learn new things.

* If the change is not trivial (ex: localization fix, etc.), it's best to create first an issue on github (bug description, proposed feature, etc.) so you can get early feedback or get support.
* Fork the repository on GitHub (if this is your first contribution)
* Create a dedicated branch for your changes
* Do the changes (keep the changes small, so they can be easily reviewed)
* Run the [Validator](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/The_Validator) on the area you changed
* Test the changes in-game to verify they work as intended
* Add yourself to credits.txt (if this is your first contribution)
* Commit and push the commit to your fork
* Open a pull request from your fork towards main repo master branch
